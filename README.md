# Real Estate Data Preprocessing and Model Development

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and feature selection for real estate data. The final model generated from this repository is used in the [Real Estate Analytics, Prediction, and Recommender System](https://github.com/Anup-repo/real-estate-analysis.git) to build a Streamlit-based web application.

## 1. Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline is responsible for cleaning and preparing the raw real estate data for analysis and modeling. This includes:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation or removal of missing data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and treating data points that deviate significantly from the rest.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Transforming categorical features into a numerical format (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
- **Scaling/Normalization**: Ensuring numerical features are on the same scale (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).

### Output:
- **Cleaned Dataset**: A dataset free from missing values and outliers, with all features properly encoded and scaled.

## 2. Feature Engineering

This module generates new features based on existing data to improve model performance.

### Techniques Used:
- **Creating Interaction Features**: Combining existing features to generate interaction terms.
- **Deriving New Features**: Example: `Price per Square Foot`, `Room-to-Size Ratio`, etc.
- **Date Feature Engineering**: Extracting information from date columns such as `Year`, `Month`, `Season`.

### Output:
- **Feature Engineered Dataset**: A dataset with enhanced feature sets for better model predictions.

## 3. Model Selection

This section involves experimenting with multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.

### Algorithms Evaluated:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Neural Networks**

### Model Evaluation:
- Models are evaluated using various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- **Cross-Validation** is performed to ensure robustness.

### Output:
- **Selected Model**: The best-performing model based on the evaluation criteria, which is saved for further use.

## 4. Feature Selection

This module selects the most important features from the dataset to avoid overfitting and improve model generalization.

### Techniques:
- **Correlation Matrix**: To identify and remove highly correlated features.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: To select important features based on model importance.
- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: To shrink less important feature coefficients to zero.

### Output:
- **Final Feature Set**: The reduced and optimal feature set used in the final model.

## 5. Output

The final model and the preprocessed dataset from this repository are exported and used as inputs for the Streamlit-based [Real Estate Analytics, Prediction, and Recommender System](https://github.com/Anup-repo/real-estate-analysis.git).
